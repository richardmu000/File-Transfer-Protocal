# File-Transfer-Protocal
Personal Project (2019)

As this project was developed without git, this is just a repository for the primary .py files for the project.

clientfinal2.py provides for the client side of the FTP. PyQT5 was used for the front end graphical user interface. PyInstaller was used to create an executable. 

server3v2 provides for the server side of the FTP. This file is run on the command line in order for current machine to be treated as a server.
